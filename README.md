## FAQs
### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
One reason why Markdown is better than a word processor is that Markdown is able to easily be converted into HTML and read and displayed by web browsers. Another reason is that Markdown is lightweight, while many word processing programs can take up a lot of memory.
### Why is my resume not showing up?
It may take up to 20 minutes for changes to your Github repository to be published.
