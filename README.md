## Instructions

### Create a new repository in GitHub

In Andrew Etter's book _Modern Technical Writing_, he explains that using a version control system to edit technical documents makes it easier for people to contribute to the documentation. Developers already use version control for their code, so they may feel more inclined to contribute to the documentation as well. Using version control for documentation also makes it very easy to make and track changes to the documents. The following steps show how to create a new repository for hosting a resume on the version control system GitHub.

1. Select the "New" button from your GitHub account home page.
2. Name the repository "_username_.github.io", where _username_ is your Github username.
3. Click on "Create repository" to create the repository.

### Add your resume to the new repository

Using a lightweight markup language such as Markdown is ideal for technical documentation because it is relativly easy to read, easy to write, and it can be easily converted into HTML and static websites. The following steps show how to upload your resume to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

1. Upload your resume file to your new repository.
2. Open the editor for your resume file in GitHub.
3. Change the name of your resume file to "index.md".

The URL of your hosted resume will be _username_.github.io.

### Style your resume with Jekyll

Static site generators such as Jekyll make generating a static website from a Markdown file very simple and easy. The followning steps describe how to use GitHub Pages to apply a Jekyll theme to your resume file.

1. Navigate to the settings menu of your new repository.
2. Select the "Pages" tab.
3. Click on the "Change theme" button to easily apply a Jekyll theme to your resume.

## FAQs
### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
One reason why Markdown is better than a word processor is that Markdown is able to easily be converted into HTML and read and displayed by web browsers. Another reason is that Markdown is lightweight, while many word processing programs can take up a lot of memory.
### Why is my resume not showing up?
It may take up to 20 minutes for changes to your GitHub repository to be published.
